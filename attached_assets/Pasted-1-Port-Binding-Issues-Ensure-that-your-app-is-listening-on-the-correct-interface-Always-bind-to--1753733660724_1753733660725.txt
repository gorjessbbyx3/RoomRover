1. Port Binding Issues:
Ensure that your app is listening on the correct interface. Always bind to 0.0.0.0 so that it is accessible externally, particularly in a deployed environment. For example:

const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;
app.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0', () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
2. Unhandled Promise Rejections:
Asynchronous functions that fail without proper error handling can crash the app. Always use try/catch blocks within async functions, or attach a .catch() for promises. Example:

async function someAsyncFunction() {
  try {
    // Your async code
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error occurred:', error);
  }
}
3. Missing Environment Variables:
The app might depend on environment variables that aren't set correctly. Verify that all necessary environment variables are defined, especially for database connections and API keys.

4. Database Connection Failures:
If your app relies on a database, ensure that the connection is functioning properly and that the database service is running. Any incorrect credentials or unreachable database services can crash the app. Use:

const mongoose = require('mongoose');
async function connectToDatabase() {
  try {
    await mongoose.connect(process.env.DB_CONNECTION_STRING);
    console.log('Database connected successfully');
  } catch (e) {
    console.error('Database connection error:', e);
  }
}
5. Syntax Errors:
Look for syntax errors in your JavaScript/TypeScript files. These can often lead to failed startups. Use your IDE or a linter to catch these before deployment.

6. Circular Dependencies:
Examine your module imports to ensure there are no circular dependencies, which can lead to unexpected issues.

7. Middleware Issues:
Check that all middleware is applied correctly. If your app uses authentication or body parsing, ensure that these middlewares are set up correctly and in the right order.

8. Excessive Resource Usage:
The app could be consuming too many resources (CPU, memory). This may require optimization of your algorithms or queries.

9. Version Conflicts:
Ensure all dependencies are compatible with each other. Mismatched versions can cause runtime errors that prevent the application from starting.

10. Error Handling:
Make sure you have a global error handler set up for Express to catch any unhandled errors:

app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
});
Review these common issues in your codebase, particularly focusing on your server files (server/routes.ts), and ensure that all setups are correct to facilitate a successful startup without crashes
