ðŸ”´ Non-Functional or Buggy Buttons
1. Submit/Create Button on Room Listing Form
File: pages/create-listing.tsx
Issue: Button exists but does not trigger onSubmit logic properly due to:

Missing form onSubmit handler

No useForm() or formState validation

Supabase insert logic might be missing or commented

ðŸ”§ Fix:

Wrap form in <form onSubmit={handleCreateListing}>

Make handleCreateListing async and include Supabase insert

2. Sign Out Button
File: components/Navbar.tsx or layout/Header.tsx
Issue: If user is not authenticated, clicking "Sign Out" either:

Throws an error

Does nothing silently (because supabase.auth.signOut() fails with no session)

ðŸ”§ Fix:
Add guard like:

ts
Copy
Edit
if (session) {
  await supabase.auth.signOut()
}
Or gray out/hide button when not signed in.

3. "Book Now" / Booking Button
File: components/RoomCard.tsx or pages/room/[id].tsx
Issue:

No logic is tied to this button.

No callback like handleBookRoom()

Not connected to Supabase insert or calendar logic

ðŸ”§ Fix:
Implement booking handler:

ts
Copy
Edit
const handleBook = async () => {
  const { error } = await supabase.from("bookings").insert({ ...data })
}
4. Upload Image Button
File: Possibly components/ImageUploader.tsx or similar
Issue: If this button exists:

No logic is wired up to Supabase.storage.upload

May accept files but not upload or give confirmation

ðŸ”§ Fix:
Make sure you're calling:

ts
Copy
Edit
const { data, error } = await supabase.storage.from('images').upload(...)
And preview using URL from:

ts
Copy
Edit
supabase.storage.from('images').getPublicUrl(...)
5. Profile Save/Update Button
File: pages/profile.tsx
Issue: Button exists but does not write changes back to Supabase.
No form onChange binding or update query attached.

ðŸ”§ Fix:
Bind form state (e.g., useState or react-hook-form) and use:

ts
Copy
Edit
supabase.from('users').update({ ...updatedData }).eq('id', user.id)
ðŸŸ¡ Buttons That Exist but Feel Incomplete
Button	Issue	Suggested Fix
Search	No loading state, no error handling	Add spinner, check empty result message
Navigation Links	Some buttons may not highlight active page	Use next/router and active class
Delete Listing	No confirmation dialog	Wrap in confirm() or modal
"View Room"	Just links to /room/[id] but doesnâ€™t verify ID validity	Add fallback UI for missing room
