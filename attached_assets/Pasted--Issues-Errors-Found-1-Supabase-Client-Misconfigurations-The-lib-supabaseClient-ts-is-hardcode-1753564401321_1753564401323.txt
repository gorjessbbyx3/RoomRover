🔍 Issues & Errors Found:
1. Supabase Client Misconfigurations
The lib/supabaseClient.ts is hardcoded with NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL and NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY. If these env vars are missing or misconfigured, it silently fails.

⚠️ Fix: Add a fallback or fail loudly when these are undefined.

2. No Input Validation / Error Handling on Forms
In your booking forms or sign-up forms, there's no try/catch for failed Supabase calls.

❌ Example: If a user tries to book a room and the request fails (e.g., due to no internet), nothing tells the user what went wrong.

3. Database Calls Not Optimized
In pages/index.tsx, the Supabase query fetches data directly inside getServerSideProps. It does not paginate or filter.

⚠️ Potential performance issue as listings grow.

4. Image Uploading Incomplete
File upload logic is referenced in the code (e.g., uploadImageToSupabase), but I couldn’t find a connected component that allows users to upload profile images or room photos.

Missing drag-and-drop, file preview, and feedback UI.

5. Profile & Listing Features Incomplete
There's a stub or placeholder for a user profile, but it's not fully wired up.

Example: /profile.tsx seems to expect Supabase data but doesn’t show error/loading states.

6. Booking System Incomplete
Booking logic (reserving a room, showing unavailable dates) isn't fully implemented.

Calendar component seems missing or minimal.

No logic for checking room availability or preventing double-booking.

7. Missing Auth Guards
Users can visit pages like /profile or /create-listing without being authenticated.

Risk: Users who aren’t logged in can access protected pages.

8. No Mobile Responsiveness in Some Pages
Some components like the navbar, profile, and listing cards don’t scale well on smaller devices. No mobile drawer or collapsible sidebar.

9. No Unit or Integration Tests
No __tests__ directory or Jest/Cypress test scripts.

⚠️ You should add tests for:

Authentication flow

Booking logic

Database queries

Component rendering (e.g., room card, filters)
