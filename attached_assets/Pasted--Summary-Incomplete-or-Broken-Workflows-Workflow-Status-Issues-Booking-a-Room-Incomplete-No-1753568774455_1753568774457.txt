🔍 Summary: Incomplete or Broken Workflows
Workflow	Status	Issues
🔴 Booking a Room	🚧 Incomplete	No logic to reserve, calendar is missing, no conflict check
🔴 Creating a Listing	🚧 Partial	No validation, image uploads incomplete, missing confirmation
🔴 Managing Helpers & Assigning Tasks	❌ Not implemented	No UI or DB structure for task assignment or tracking
🔴 Membership Gating (Free vs Premium)	🚧 Partial	UI mentions exist, but not enforced in routing or features
🔴 User Role Guard (manager/helper/guest)	🚧 Partial	No middleware or per-page protection by role
🔴 Viewing or Updating Profile Info	🚧 Partial	Page exists, but does not update data back to Supabase
🔴 Stripe / Payment Flow	❌ Missing	No backend API or webhook integration
🔴 Favorites / Saved Listings	❌ Missing	No database logic or UI for saving/favoriting
🟡 Authentication (Login/Register)	✅ Mostly working	No email verification, forgot password UX may be missing
🔴 Dashboard (Manager & Helper)	🚧 Static only	No Supabase-connected data, no role-based views

🔎 Workflow Deep Dive
1. 🛏️ Room Booking Flow
Goal: User picks a listing, selects date, books it

❌ No calendar or date picker

❌ No check for overlapping bookings

❌ No bookings table or Supabase insert logic

❌ No payment integration (if needed)

Fix suggestion:

Add bookings table

Build a <DateRangePicker /> + <BookNowButton />

Use Supabase RLS to guard bookings per user

2. 🏡 Listing Creation
Goal: Manager creates a property listing with photos

✅ Basic form exists

❌ Supabase insert may not be triggered properly

❌ No validation (e.g., empty fields, invalid data)

❌ Image upload not wired up fully

❌ No post-submit redirect or success message

3. 🧹 Helper Task Assignment
Goal: Manager assigns tasks to helpers (cleaning, repairs)

❌ No tasks or helpers table in DB

❌ No UI for managers to assign tasks

❌ No task list UI for helpers

❌ No progress tracking (open → in progress → done)

4. 🪪 Membership Upgrade / Gating
Goal: Only premium users can access premium features

⚠️ Membership UI references exist

❌ No Supabase memberships table yet (you’re working on it)

❌ No middleware/HOC to block access to premium features

❌ No visual alerts like “Upgrade to access this”

5. 🧑‍💼 Role-Based Dashboards
Goal: Managers and helpers see different data

✅ Separate dashboard files exist (e.g., /dashboard/manager.tsx)

❌ Data is hardcoded or missing

❌ No role-based redirect guard

❌ No reusable <DashboardCard> components

❌ No visual distinction between helper/manager UIs

6. 🧾 Profile Editing
Goal: User updates bio, image, or preferences

✅ Page exists

❌ Supabase update not wired to form

❌ No success toast or feedback

❌ No image picker

7. 💳 Stripe Payment Flow
Goal: Upgrade to premium via card checkout

❌ No checkout flow

❌ No webhook to record payment success

❌ No Stripe customer/subscription mapping to user ID

❌ No plan metadata (e.g., Pro vs Premium tiers)

8. ❤️ Favorites System
Goal: Users save listings to view later

❌ No favorites table

❌ No “Save” button in listing cards

❌ No GET /favorites for dashboard view

🧠 Most Critical Gaps (for MVP)
Booking Workflow — needs backend + date conflict logic

Task Assignment Workflow — critical if helpers are a core feature

Membership Enforcement — if monetization is your goal

Protected Routes by Role — needed for helper/manager split

Dynamic Dashboards — static dashboards won’t help real users
