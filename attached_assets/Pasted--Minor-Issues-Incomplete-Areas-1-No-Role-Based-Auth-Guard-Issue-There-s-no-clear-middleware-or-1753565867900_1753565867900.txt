🟠 Minor Issues / Incomplete Areas
1. No Role-Based Auth Guard
Issue: There’s no clear middleware or frontend logic that:

Redirects unauthorized users (e.g., guest trying to access /dashboard/manager)

Prevents API access based on role

🔧 Fix Suggestion:
Create a withRoleGuard HOC or use middleware like:

ts
Copy
Edit
if (user?.role !== 'manager') {
  return redirect('/unauthorized')
}
2. Dashboard Pages Are Mostly Static
Issue: Your manager/helper dashboards don’t show dynamic data yet.

No Supabase queries to fetch listings, tasks, helpers, or reports

Buttons or stats shown don’t reflect real-time activity

🔧 Fix Suggestion:
Add this to your dashboard page:

ts
Copy
Edit
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('listings')
  .select('*')
  .eq('manager_id', user.id)
Then render assigned properties, bookings, or task queues.

3. No Navigation UI Between Dashboards
Issue: Managers and Helpers can't easily navigate between views or switch context (e.g., Manager wants to impersonate a helper).

🔧 Fix Suggestion:
Add a role-aware sidebar/nav:

ts
Copy
Edit
if (role === 'manager') {
  show links for: ['My Listings', 'Assign Helper', 'Reports']
} else if (role === 'helper') {
  show links for: ['Assigned Tasks', 'Time Tracker']
}
4. No Task Management or Booking Workflow
Issue: For Helpers:

No task list UI (e.g., cleanings, repairs)

No logic to mark tasks complete or accept assignments

For Managers:

No control panel to assign helpers to listings

No visibility into current helper workload

🔧 Fix Suggestion:
Create tasks table:

ts
Copy
Edit
id | listing_id | helper_id | description | due_date | status
Then:

Managers create/assign tasks

Helpers view/mark complete

5. No Metrics or Analytics Yet
Dashboards are usually about quick insight — but there’s no current:

Booking stats

Active rooms

Helper performance

Revenue overview (if planned)

🔧 You could add:

ts
Copy
Edit
const totalBookings = await supabase
  .from('bookings')
  .select('id', { count: 'exact' })
  .eq('manager_id', user.id)
