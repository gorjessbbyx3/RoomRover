## Data Flow

### Authentication Flow
1. User submits credentials via login form
2. Server validates against user database
3. JWT token generated and returned to client
4. Token stored in localStorage for session persistence
5. Subsequent requests include Bearer token in Authorization header

### Booking Workflow
1. Guest inquiry submitted through public form
2. Admin reviews and approves inquiry
3. Booking created with room assignment
4. Door codes generated with appropriate expiration
5. Payment verification before code activation
6. Cleaning tasks automatically generated post-checkout

### Task Management Flow
1. Tasks created automatically (post-checkout cleaning) or manually
2. Assignment based on user roles and property access
3. Progress tracking through status updates
4. Completion logging with timestamps and user attribution

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **Database**: `@neondatabase/serverless` for PostgreSQL connectivity
- **ORM**: `drizzle-orm` and `drizzle-zod` for type-safe database operations
- **UI Components**: Extensive Radix UI component suite
- **Validation**: Zod for runtime type checking and form validation
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with `class-variance-authority` for component variants

### Development Tools
- **Type Checking**: TypeScript with strict configuration
- **Build Tools**: Vite for development, ESBuild for production
- **Code Quality**: ESLint and Prettier (configured via editor)
- **Replit Integration**: Custom Vite plugins for Replit development environment

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Replit-hosted development with hot module replacement
- Environment variable configuration for database connections
- Development-specific error overlays and debugging tools

### Production Considerations
- Single-page application build output to `dist/public`
- Server-side rendering disabled for simplified deployment
- Static asset serving through Express.js
- Environment-based configuration switching

### Database Management
- Migration-based schema management
- Seed data for initial property and user setup
- Connection pooling through Neon serverless architecture

### Security Measures
- Role-based route protection
- Input validation at API boundaries
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Environment variable protection for sensitive configuration
- CORS and security headers configuration

The application is designed for single-developer operation with emphasis on rapid development, mobile accessibility, and discrete operation suitable for boutique hospitality management.
