## Data Flow

### Authentication Flow
1. User submits credentials via login form
2. Server validates against user database
3. JWT token generated and returned to client
4. Token stored in localStorage for session persistence
5. Subsequent requests include Bearer token in Authorization header

### Booking Workflow
1. Guest inquiry submitted through public form
2. Admin reviews and approves inquiry
3. Booking created with room assignment
4. Door codes generated with appropriate expiration
5. Payment verification before code activation
6. Cleaning tasks automatically generated post-checkout

### Task Management Flow
1. Tasks created automatically (post-checkout cleaning) or manually
2. Assignment based on user roles and property access
3. Progress tracking through status updates
4. Completion logging with timestamps and user attribution

## External Dependencies

### Production Considerations
- Single-page application build output to `dist/public`
- Server-side rendering disabled for simplified deployment
- Static asset serving through Express.js
- Environment-based configuration switching

### Database Management
- Migration-based schema management
- Seed data for initial property and user setup
